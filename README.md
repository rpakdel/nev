node-eyefi-viewer
=================

A Node.js based server and viewer for the Eye-Fi Wifi cards.

Notes
=====

- Only <server_ip>:8080/single URL works
- Pretty rough code as I'm learning Node and Javascript.
- Only .JPG images are supported.
- Make sure the Eye-Fi centre app is not running.
- I don't recommend using the uploaded images. Attach the card to your computer and upload the images directly or use Eye-Fi app.

Installation
============

- Install GraphicsMagick.
- setup your card key in config.js.
